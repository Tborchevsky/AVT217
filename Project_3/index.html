			Summary: Taking place 40 years after the events of the 1978 Original Halloween, this new direct followup wipes the slate clean of the past 10 sequels. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Mostly it's the troubled times we live in that allows this energizing, elemental horror film to touch a raw nerve for #MeToo

			While it doesn’t capture the magic of the original, this Halloween brings much-needed closure to a troubled franchise, with Curtis excellent and Michael Myers pleasingly terrifying again.

			Finally, Hollywood has made a good “Halloween” sequel. It took them only 40 years.

				Summary: Widows is a crime epic which sees the widows of a group of robbers come together to pull off one last heist. 
				</p>
				<p>
				McQueen creates a hypnotic panorama of everyday corruption that feels less like a crime caper than like something out of a Robert Altman film or a Richard Price novel.
				<br>
				Owen Gliberman
				</p>
				<p>
				The movie, believe it or not, gives pleasure. It’s a stark, violent, cynical but thoroughly entertaining caper picture.
				<br>

				<p>
				Steve McQueen directs Widows with such aplomb and style that even the occasional large leaps of faith that the plot and storyline demand from the audience seem a small price to pay for such delights.

				Summary: The second film in the harry potter prequel series. This installment has Newt facing off against Grindlewald with the aid of Dumbledore. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Fantastic Beasts and The Crimes of Grindelwald is a magical must-see! It builds upon the original & is sure to delight Harry Potter fans. Remarkable visuals, engaging story, & an ending that will leave you speechless. Johnny Depp as Grindelwald is perfection.

				Summary: Life has become a balancing act for Adonis Creed. Between personal obligations and training for his next big fight, he is up against the challenge of his life. Facing an opponent with ties to his family's past only intensifies his impending battle in the ring. Rocky Balboa is there by his side through it all and, together, Rocky and Adonis will confront their shared legacy, question what's worth fighting for, and discover that nothing's more important than family. Creed II is about going back to basics to rediscover what made you a champion in the first place, and remembering that, no matter where you go, you can't escape your history.
