	The Covenant used these stocky aliens as cannon fodder. They stood a meter tall and wore armored
environment suits that replicated the atmosphere of their frozen homeworld. They reminded the Chief of
biped dogs, not only in appearance, but because their speech—even with the new translation software—
was an odd combination of high-pitched squeaks, guttural barks, and growls.
	They were about as smart as dogs, too. But what they lacked in brainpower, they made up for in sheer
tenacity. He had seen them hurl themselves at their enemies until the ground was piled high with their
corpses . . . and their opponents had depleted their ammunition.
These Grunts were unusually well armed: needlers, plasma pistols, and there were four stationary
plasma cannons. Those could be a problem.
One other problem: there were easily a thousand of <a href="../halo.html">them.</a>
</p>

<p>
	Finally the Grunts realized what was happening—and where this attack was coming from. They
regrouped and chargeden masse . An earthquake vibration coursed through the ground and shook the 
porous stone beneath the Chief’s <a href="../Halo.html">boots.</a>

<P>
	The Grunts were three meters from the wall.
	Two dull thumps reverberated though the ground. The squeals and barks of the incoming Grunts,
however, drowned out the noise of the exploding <a href="../halo.html">grenades.</a>
</p>

<p>
The Grunts looked like a living carpet of steel-blue skin, claws, and chrome weapons. Some ran on all
fours up the slope. They barked and howled, baying for the Spartans’ <a href="../Chief/index.html">blood.<
</p>

<p>
The Banshees screamed over their heads—then banked sharply for another <a href="../Chief/index.html">pass.</a>
</p>

<p>
The Banshees formed into a “flying V” and swooped toward them, almost brushing the <a href="../halo.html">ground.</a>
</p>

<p>
The Banshees were one hundred meters away, then fifty meters. Their plasma weapons might recycle
fast enough to get another shot . . . and at this range, the Chief wouldn’t be <a href="../halo.html">dodging.</a>
