	“Four of us,” Blue-Two whispered over the link. “And a thousand of them? Piss-poor odds for the little
<a href="../Chief/index.html">guys.”</a>

	Blue-Two leaped gracefully atop the ridge—three meters straight up. There was no sound as the half ton
of MJOLNIR armor and Spartan landed on the limestone.
She hefted one launcher and ran along the ridge—she was the fastest Spartan on the Chief’s team. He
was confident those Grunts wouldn’t be able to track her for the three seconds she’d be exposed. In
quick succession, Blue-Two emptied both of the Jackhammer’s tubes, dropped one launcher, and then
fired the other rockets just as fast. The shells streaked into the Grunts’ formation and detonated. One of
the stationary guns flipped over, engulfed in the blast, and the gunner was flung to the ground.
She ditched the launcher, jumped down—rolled once—and was back on her feet, running at top speed to
the fallback <a href="../Halo.html">point.</a>

<p>
“Aye aye.” She patched him into the SATCOM <a href="../Chief/index.html">system.</a>
</p>

Blue-Two took off her helmet and scratched the stubble of her brown hair. “It’s a shame to leave this
place,” she said, and leaned against the porthole. “There are so few left.”
The Chief stood by her and glanced out as they lifted into the air—there were wide rolling plains of
palmgrass, the green expanse of ocean, a wispy band of clouds in the sky, and setting red <a href="../Chief/index.html">suns.</a>
</p>

<p>
“Will there?” she <a href="../halo.html">whispered.</a>
